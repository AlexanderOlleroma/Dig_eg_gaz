A vocal concert in which some excellent singing was heard, was succeeded by the second part of the Italian drama XXIX Luglio, and this was followed by the Spanish zarzuela La Gran Via, but want of space prevents us referring to any of these in detaiL On Friday Cairo will congregate at the Esbekieh Theatre to witness the performance of Chemineau by the Gardet troupe, which is proving such a great attraction to Cairo theatre-goers, and the proceeds of this performance will also be devoted to the relief fund.

                <p>This match, probably the last of the present season, was played on the A.C.C. ground Friday afternoon. The Regimental XI. won the toss and went in first, but started badly, losing two wickets in the first over. Captain Moore and Murphy made a good stand, both hitting very freely and putting on 42 runs for the fourth wicket, but after their dismissal Major Finch was the only batsman to give much trouble.
                </p>
                <p>The A.C.C. on going in made a bad start, losing two wickets for nine runs, but J. G. Maclaren, who completed his 1,000 runs for the season amid considerable applause, helped Stacey to carry. the score to 51 and H. B. Carver and Stacey quickly made matters safe. Both hit very freely, Stacey scoring 14 fours in his 69, while Carver hit two fives and eight boundaries.
                </p>
               <p> The Cricket club was "at home” in honor of the occasion during the match and the pavilion was crowded. Among those present were Mr. M. de C.
